# Concrete-Crack-Images-for-Classification

Welcome to the **Concrete-Crack-Images-for-Classification** repository! This project uses machine learning techniques to classify concrete crack images into different categories. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification to detect cracks and assess the severity of damage in concrete structures.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify concrete cracks from images, helping in infrastructure maintenance and safety assessments. The project uses a dataset of concrete crack images, and the model is trained to identify different levels of damage or categorize the cracks.

### **Repository Structure**
- **`README.md`**: This file you're reading.
- **`creack_classification.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the CNN model for crack classification.
- **`accuracy and loss visualization.png`**: A graphical representation of the training accuracy and loss over time.
- **`Dataset/`**: Folder containing the dataset with concrete crack images for classification.
